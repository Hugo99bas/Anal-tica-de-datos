# Python libraries and an introduction to data manipulation

The core Python language is by design somewhat minimal.  Like other programming languages, Python has an ecosystem of modules (libraries of code) that augument the base language.  Some of these libraries are "standard", meaning that they are included with your Python distribution.  Many other open source libraries can be obtained from the organizations that support their development.

Think of a library as a collection of functions and data types that can be accessed to complete certain programming tasks without having to implement everything yourself from scratch.

This course will make extensive use of the following libraries:

* **[Numpy](http://numpy.org)** is a library for working with arrays of data.

* **[Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)** provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools.

* **[Scipy](http://scipy.org)** is a library of techniques for numerical and scientific computing.

* **[Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org)** is a library for making graphs.

* **[Seaborn](http://seaborn.pydata.org)** is a higher-level interface to Matplotlib that can be used to simplify many graphing tasks.

* **[Statsmodels](http://www.statsmodels.org)** is a library that implements many statistical techniques.

This notebook introduces the Pandas and Numpy libraries, which are used to manipulate datasets.
